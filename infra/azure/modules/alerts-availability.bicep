// alerts-availability.bicep — "email me if the site is down", from outside.
//
// Every other rule in this deployment reads a signal the platform emitted about
// itself, which means all of them share one blind spot: a platform that is not
// running emits nothing, and silence is indistinguishable from health. These are
// the only rules that look at the platform from OUTSIDE the platform.
//
// Azure calls this an Application Insights **availability test**. Two kinds
// exist and only one is usable: the old free `ping` test RETIRES 30 SEPTEMBER
// 2026 (existing ones are deleted from the resource), so these are `standard`
// tests — billed per execution, and worth it for the three things ping could not
// do: a body content match, TLS certificate validation, and a proactive check on
// how many days the certificate has left.
//
// WHAT IT PROBES, and why that URL. `/health` on an APP host serves app content
// (a deployed file called `/health`, or the SPA fallback) — the edge's host
// router mounts platform routes on platform hosts only. `auth.<appsDomain>` is
// the auth host and answers the platform health JSON, so that is the edge's
// probe URL. `dev-api.<appsDomain>` deliberately is NOT probed even when the
// dev-gateway is deployed: `dev-api` is a valid app slug and is not in
// RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS, so the edge image classifies that host as an app and
// serves assets from it — a probe there gets a 404, not a health body.
//
// EGRESS CANNOT BE PROBED AT ALL. It lives in an internal-only environment with
// no public load balancer, which is the ADR-0001 boundary working as designed.
// An availability test runs from public Azure regions, so nothing here can reach
// it; egress liveness is inferred from the edge's fetch-proxy spans instead. The
// portal is only probed when `portalExternal` put it on the public LB.
//
// READING THE BODY IS THE POINT. `/health` always answers 200, in every state,
// on purpose (ADR-0025: a non-200 would let a liveness probe restart a replica
// that is serving correctly from a stale projection). That is exactly why no ACA
// probe can grade it and why `TODO.md` carried "nothing probes the
// registry-projection sub-check" as an open residual. A standard test's content
// validation reads the body, so this is the probe that residual wanted.
