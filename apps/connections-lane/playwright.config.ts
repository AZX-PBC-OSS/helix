/**
 * The connections browser lane (I-02 T-0031, ADR-0010 part 2) — real-Chromium
 * acceptance for the OAuth-connections popup journeys, separate from the jsdom
 * SPA project and from the vitest run entirely.
 *
 * Headed, under Xvfb (both locally and in CI): with Playwright's CDP defaults
 * the popup blocker never fires, and the blocked-open journey (criterion 26)
 * must be ENGINE evidence. Two changes make it fire:
 *   - `--disable-popup-blocking` is removed from the default args, which
 *     restores Chromium's one-popup-per-user-gesture blocking; and
 *   - the browser runs headed (headless Chromium keeps popups unblocked under
 *     automation even with the switch removed — measured).
 * Run through `xvfb-run -a pnpm --filter @azx-pbc/connections-lane test`
 * (README has the details; the CI job does exactly this).
