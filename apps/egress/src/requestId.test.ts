 * a fetch-proxy call — which today land in two different Log Analytics
 * workspaces with nothing in common but a timestamp.
 *
 * These drive `/health` rather than `/proxy`: `req.id` is assigned by Fastify
 * before any route runs, so the cheapest unauthenticated route exercises the
 * generator without standing up an instruction, a burn store and an upstream.
