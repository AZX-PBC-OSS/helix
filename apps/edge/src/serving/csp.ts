/**
 * CSP for every app response (architecture §4.4, ADR-0009). Approved
 * externalOrigins extend connect-src/img-src; report-uri sends violations to
 * the edge. Apply it to all asset types because SVG, XHTML, and XML can execute
 * scripts too.
 *
 * Apps are untrusted. Restrict connections to approved destinations, forms to
 * self, framing to none, and base URLs to self. form-action must be explicit;
 * it does not inherit default-src. Inline scripts/styles, eval, wasm, and
 * curated CDNs are allowed for generated-app compatibility. Open HTTPS images
 * and navigation remain possible data-exfiltration channels.
 *
 * Keep unsafe-inline: the fetch shim and offline registration are inlined so
 * they work on offline startup, and apps may have their own inline scripts.
 * Adding a script hash or nonce makes CSP3 browsers ignore unsafe-inline.
 *
 * worker-src self/blob permits dedicated and shared workers. Service workers
 * require HTTP(S) URLs; they cannot register from blob URLs. The asset handler
 * rejects app-supplied service workers because a root-scoped worker could read
 * the auth handoff URL. The offline worker is platform-owned and scope-limited
 * (ADR-0035). This CSP also governs that worker's own fetch requests.
