/**
 * `POST /_api/llm/chat` — the gateway's LLM capability (architecture §6.1,
 * project plan §4 M4). The choke point that makes per-app blast-radius real:
 * it authenticates the user (session gate), proves the request came from the
 * app's own origin (CSRF — §4.2), enforces the per-app model allowlist and
 * daily spend budget from the manifest (§6.3), proxies to the vendor through
 * the `LlmProvider` seam (the app never sees the key), and meters every call.
 *
 * Quota is **block-new, finish-in-flight**: the budget is checked once at
 * admission; an admitted request always runs to completion, even if it pushes
 * the app over budget — the next request is the one that gets blocked.
 *
 * The budget is denominated in **USD**, not tokens, so the cap means the same
 * thing across models (a token cap is a 10× range of dollars between haiku and
 * fable-5). Two windows are checked off the frozen `costMicroUsd` ledger column:
 * a calendar-day cap (the cost control — bounds the daily bill) and a rolling
 * 1-hour burst cap at a fraction of it (an availability control — a single
 * actor can't drain the whole day in one spike and lock the app out for 24h).

 * divisor at 6, draining the daily budget takes at least 6 hours. This is an

 * freely. The 1-hour window length itself lives in the SQL (usage.ts).
