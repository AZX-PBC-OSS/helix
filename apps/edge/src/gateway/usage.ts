/**
 * The gateway call ledger (architecture §6.1/§6.3, §8) — metering + audit and
 * the source of truth for per-app daily token budgets. Lives in the portal-
 * migrated `gateway_calls` table, accessed with hand-written SQL (no ORM in the
 * edge — project plan §1).
 *
 * This is the one place the edge **writes** product data. The widening from the
 * edge's otherwise read-only posture is deliberate and narrow: INSERT a row per
 * call, and SUM today's tokens to admit or block the next one. No secrets, no
 * registry writes.
 *
 * Every access runs through `withPartition` so the `gateway_calls_edge_partition`
 * RLS policy (ADR-0002) scopes it to the request's app: the per-app budget SUMs
 * and the metering INSERT can only ever see / write this app's rows, and a path
 * that forgot the `app.app_id` GUC matches zero rows / fails the WITH CHECK
 * (fail-closed) rather than crossing tenants. Metering is per-app, so only
 * `app.app_id` is set (no `app.user_oid`). The txn adds a round-trip to the
 * metering hot path — an accepted cost for the fail-closed backstop.

 *    are the same shape, so any entropy test that catches `/bot<TOKEN>` also
 *    eats `/customers/<uuid>/orders` — the value this column exists to capture.

 *    (ADR-0021). The ledger is the stricter store of the two: log lines age out,
 *    ledger rows have no DELETE grant for any role.
 *  - **The length is capped.** The path is attacker-controlled — it is whatever
 *    the hosted app put in the URL — and `gateway_calls` is append-only with no
