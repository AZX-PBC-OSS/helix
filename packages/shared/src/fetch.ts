 * it satisfies `connect-src 'self'` with no CSP widening; method, safelisted
 * headers, and body pass through, and the response streams back unchanged
 * (§3.1). The edge enforces policy and forwards to `helix-egress` over an internal
 * HTTP seam carrying the attested instruction; egress performs the call. The
 * shapes here are the small pieces both services (and tests) share — there is no
 * JSON envelope, because the proxy is transparent and streaming.

 * response. `blocked` is an SSRF refusal; `bad_target` a malformed/undecodable
 * target; `too_large` a request body over the size cap (413, refused before the
 * upstream call); `replay` a re-presented attested instruction whose one-time
 * `jti` was already burned (409, refused at egress before any upstream call —
 * ADR-0013 Step 1, issue #3); `upstream_error` an egress/transport failure. (A
 * *response* over the cap cannot use this code — status + headers are already
 * flushed by the time the byte counter trips, so the body is truncated instead;
 * see issue #8 and `@azx-pbc/shared` `capBody`.)
 *
 * The delegated-call codes (I-02) name why a provider-bound call could not be
 * served, each distinguishable from a consent problem (spec criteria 33–34;
 * design.md §App-facing contracts, the error table): `connection_required`
 * (403) — no or dead connection, a definitive grant rejection, an uncertain
 * rotation, or a caller that can never hold a connection (anonymous,
 * shared-password); the body carries {@link FetchErrorProvider} so the app can
 * offer Connect. `provider_unavailable` (503) — the provider was deleted or its
 * binding blocked by a sensitive edit. `provider_misconfigured` (502) — invalid
 * provider configuration; administrator action required. The first code is a
 * consent problem and the other two are not — that is the distinction the
 * ledger's `connection_required` outcome label tracks.
 *
 * Every code's message is a fixed platform string — never vendor error content,
 * credentials, or internal detail.
