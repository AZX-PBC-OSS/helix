 * decision that shifts independently of the data. We keep the rate table here in
 * `@azx-pbc/shared` and recompute dollars when the portal reads the ledger, so a
 * price change is a map edit + redeploy — and historical figures move to the
 * current rate (an "estimated spend at today's rates" model, not frozen billing).
 *
 * **Cache-aware:** Anthropic bills the three input-token classes at different
 * rates — uncached input at 1x, a cache *write* at 1.25x (5-minute TTL), a cache
 * *read* at 0.1x (0.025x on Fable 5.1). Collapsing them into one number makes spend wrong for
 * cache-heavy apps, so `costUsd` prices each class separately. (Cache counts are
 * 0 until prompt caching is enabled — see apps/edge/src/gateway/provider.ts.)
