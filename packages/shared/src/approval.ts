 * sharedRead, collections, sharedWrite, …`), so every data-area approve read a
 * value that never moved as "changed" and auto-bounced to `needs_changes`. The
 * first data-area elevated grant that anyone actually approved was a
 * `sharedWritePrefixes` prefix (ADR-0042), which is what surfaced it.
