# Helix — AZX App Platform

> ⚠️ **Alpha — not yet suitable for public consumption.** Helix is under active
> development. Interfaces, data formats, and security posture are still changing,
> there is no stability or support guarantee, and it has not been hardened for
> production or third-party use. Use at your own risk.

Helix hosts AI-generated static web apps with platform-managed authentication,
API credentials, data storage, quotas, and audit. Every hosted app is treated as
untrusted code, with access restricted per app.

Start with [TOUR.md](./TOUR.md) for the repository map or
[the system overview](./docs/OVERVIEW.md) for the product and architecture.
[Feature docs](./docs/features/) describe current behavior;
[the project plan](./docs/platform-project-plan.md) tracks implementation status.
[The docs index](./docs/README.md) maps the remaining documentation.

Helix runs on Azure Container Apps with Entra OIDC, wildcard TLS, and Key Vault.
The same stack runs locally using the dev IdP, Azurite, and local encrypted secret
storage. The gateway supports LLM calls, app data, and proxied HTTP requests.
The portal supports deploys, capability approvals, and secret-backed connections.
Apps can also use a platform-managed offline worker and an isolated development
tier. Remaining M5 work includes an end-to-end pilot app and confirmation that the
optional egress firewall is enabled in live deployments.

```

## Prerequisites

Open the repo in the **dev container** (VS Code: _Reopen in Container_). It provides Node 24,
pnpm, and the `db` (Postgres 18) + `azurite` (Blob) services, with `DATABASE_URL` and the
per-role DSNs, `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`, the M3 auth env (`EDGE_OIDC_*`,
`EDGE_AUTH_SECRET`, `PORTAL_OIDC_*`, `EDGE_TLS_*`), the egress env
(`HELIX_INSTRUCTION_SECRET` for the edge↔egress attested instruction), and dev mode
(`EDGE_ALLOW_DEV_MODE`) already set. The least-privilege Postgres roles (`helix_portal`,
`helix_edge`, `helix_egress`, `helix_dev`) are created on first DB init by
`.devcontainer/db-init/`. `pnpm install` runs on create, and post-create generates a mkcert
wildcard cert for `*.local.helix.azxlabs.io` into `.devcontainer/certs/` (gitignored) plus the
dev secret-store KEK.

### The platform is HTTPS-only

There is no plain-HTTP mode, even locally. `__Host-` session cookies require `Secure`, and
hosted apps' crypto APIs (`crypto.randomUUID`, SubtleCrypto) only exist in a
[secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) — so
the edge **refuses to boot in dev without TLS**. The dev container terminates TLS itself with
mkcert; production terminates at ingress. Your host browser may warn about
the local certificate. Accept it for local development, or import
`.devcontainer/certs/caroot/rootCA.pem` into your OS/browser trust store. Node
processes inside the container already trust the CA via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.

## Local dev: the processes

```bash
pnpm dev:idp      # :3002 — local OIDC issuer (apps/dev-idp). Fixture users below.
pnpm dev:portal   # :3001 — registry + deploy API (also serves the built SPA)
pnpm dev:edge     # :8080 — HTTPS. Apps at https://<slug>.local.helix.azxlabs.io:8080,
                  #         login on https://auth.local.helix.azxlabs.io:8080
pnpm dev:egress   # :8081 — mechanism plane (fetch-proxy + secret injection).
                  #         Needed for /_api/fetch, connections, and the LLM gateway.
pnpm dev:devgw    # :8082 — HTTPS. The dev-gateway: develop an app against its
                  #         isolated env=dev tier from a browser builder / localhost (see below).
pnpm dev:web      # :5173 — the SPA dev server (proxies /api + /health to :3001)
pnpm dev:clean    #         free any of those ports left held by a dead process
```

`*.local.helix.azxlabs.io` resolves to `127.0.0.1`, so app subdomains and the auth host work with no
`/etc/hosts` edits. Fixture identities at the IdP (pick one on the login page):

| User              | Groups                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `alice@azx.dev`   | `eng-team`, `platform-admin` |
| `bob@azx.dev`     | `eng-team`                   |
| `mallory@azx.dev` | _none_ (for group-denial)    |

The dev container leaves `EDGE_DEV_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` **off**, so local dev mirrors reality:
app navigations 302 into the real SSO flow and the session-gated `/_api/*` gateway is exercisable
from the browser. To serve app content without logging in — debugging asset serving in isolation,
say — start the edge with the bypass on (it skips the **session gate** only, never TLS):

```bash
EDGE_DEV_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true pnpm dev:edge
```

## Deploy an app and log in

In the portal SPA, create an app and upload a build folder or zip. The portal
validates the bundle and offers repairs for supported packaging problems.
To deploy from the CLI (`npm i -g @azx-pbc/helix-cli`, or run it out of the workspace as below), from
inside the app directory:

```bash
# 0. Run the CLI from the working tree:
alias helix='node --import tsx /workspace/packages/cli/src/bin.ts'

# 1. Sign the CLI in (OIDC device flow against the dev IdP). Or export
#    HELIX_TOKEN=$PORTAL_DEV_TOKEN to use the static dev token instead.
cd examples/notes
helix login                 # prints a URL + code; pick alice

# 2. Register + deploy + promote (slug/dir come from helix.json):
helix create
helix deploy --promote

# 3. Open it (accept the cert warning the first time):
open https://notes.local.helix.azxlabs.io:8080/
```

`helix` is **cwd-driven** — it reads `helix.json`, and resolves `--dir`, from the directory you
are standing in, like `git`. That is why the alias above points at an absolute path, and why
`pnpm --filter @azx-pbc/helix-cli helix` is the one form to avoid for a real deploy: `--filter`
runs with the cwd inside `packages/cli`, where the app isn't.

The examples' `helix.json` deliberately omits `portalUrl` — a checked-in portal URL would be
wrong for every deployment but one — so the CLI falls back to `http://localhost:3001`, which is
right here and nowhere else. Against a deployed portal, set `portalUrl` (or `HELIX_PORTAL_URL`);
the portal prints the exact file to copy under **How to develop → On your machine**.

With the gate on (the default), an unauthenticated visit 302s to the login page; pick a fixture
user and you land back on the app with a host-scoped session. `GET /_api/me` returns the
signed-in user. To exercise the **LLM gateway** locally, run `pnpm dev:egress` and seed a
`platform`-scoped secret named `anthropic` (portal → Secrets) — the edge never holds a vendor
key, so the capability fails closed until egress can resolve one (ADR-0008).

See [`apps/edge/README.md`](./apps/edge/README.md) for the request flow and config,
[`apps/dev-idp/README.md`](./apps/dev-idp/README.md) for the IdP, and
[`packages/cli/README.md`](./packages/cli/README.md) for the CLI and its auth.

## Develop an app against Helix (dev mode)

The flow above _deploys_ a finished app. To iterate on an app that's still being written
elsewhere — on `localhost`, in a browser builder, in a cloud IDE — and have it call the real
platform (LLM, data, fetch) as you go, use **dev mode**: an isolated `env=dev` tier on the same
app, reached through the **dev-gateway** (`pnpm dev:devgw`, `:8082`). It never touches production
data, budget, or secrets, and promotion later moves _code_, never dev data.

```bash
# 1. Create the app (no code needed yet) and grant its capabilities in the portal.
# 2. In the portal "Dev mode" tab: register your app's origin (e.g. http://localhost:5173
#    or your builder's URL) and mint a dev token (shown once, azxdev_…). Configure any
#    env=dev connection secrets in the "Secrets" tab (Tier → dev).
# 3. From your in-development app, call the dev-gateway — same /_api/* shape as prod,
#    slug in the path, token as a bearer:
curl -k -X PUT https://dev-api.local.helix.azxlabs.io:8082/<slug>/_api/data/user/todo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer azxdev_…" -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -d '["milk","eggs"]'
```

The full walkthrough (surfaces, isolation, and what's not yet built — `helix dev` and the client
SDK) is in [`docs/features/dev-mode.md`](./docs/features/dev-mode.md). The dev-gateway is
opt-in (`EDGE_ALLOW_DEV_MODE`, on in the dev container) and runs as the least-privilege
`helix_dev` role, so it physically can't read a production row.

| `pnpm --filter @azx-pbc/portal db:migrate` | Create/apply a Prisma migration (dev)                          |
| `./check-and-lint.sh`                      | Full CI checks: typecheck + lint + format + docs build + tests |

`./check-and-lint.sh` (add `--fix` to auto-fix first) is the same gate CI runs, and a change
isn't finished until it passes clean. CI invokes this same script, splitting it across two
jobs by naming steps (`./check-and-lint.sh typecheck lint format docs` and `… test`) —
running it bare locally covers both.

## Conventions

- **TypeScript everywhere, ESM, Node 24.** Strict `tsconfig.base.json`, extended per package.
- **Versions via the pnpm catalog** in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — bump in one place.
- **zod at every boundary** (`@azx-pbc/shared`); inferred types travel with the schemas.
- Adding a runtime dependency to `apps/edge` requires justification at review time
  (project plan §6) — it is code inside the trusted path.
- **M3 auth code gets adversarial tests with it, not after.** The OIDC handoff is the most
  security-sensitive path in the platform (`apps/edge/src/auth/adversarial.test.ts`).
